## Overview

MobileCoin is a payment network with no central authority. The fundamental goal of the network is to safely and 
efficiently enable the exchange of value, represented as fractional ownership of the total value of the network. 
Like most cryptocurrencies, MobileCoin maintains a permanent and immutable record of all successfully completed 
payments in a blockchain data structure. Cryptography is used extensively to establish ownership, control transfers, 
and to preserve cash-like privacy for users.

For more information about the cryptocurrency, see [MobileCoinFoundation/MobileCoin](https://github.com/mobilecoinfoundation/mobilecoin).
